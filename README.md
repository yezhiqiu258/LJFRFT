# Trainable Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform 

This repository contains the structural code and core model components associated with our manuscript titled "Trainable Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform", which is currently under review for publication in *Signal Processing*.

To ensure the protection of original contributions during the peer-review process, the executable scripts are temporarily withheld. Upon formal acceptance of the manuscript, we will release the complete implementation, including:

- Full source code with run-ready scripts  
- Data preprocessing tools  
- Experiment configuration files  
- Detailed usage and reproducibility instructions  

Note: This repository is currently restricted and will be made fully public after paper acceptance.

If you have any questions regarding the code or the method, feel free to contact the authors.
